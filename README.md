A collection for Duke courses related code.

## ECE551 Data Structures and Algorithm
Learnt someting about coding. Never copy code from other sources. Childish toy projects might not be severe, but industrial ones really hurts!

## ECE581 Random signals and processes
Some ROC curves plotting with matlab. Also an important note from Oppenheim's, about MMSE.

## ECE587 Information Theory
Really helpful and thought-provoking by Prof. Galen Reeves.
A simple project of algorithm composing with Python. The project will be put in another repository.

...to be continued.
